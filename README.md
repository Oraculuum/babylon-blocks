## About

[Google Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) is an open source library for building visual programming editors and is used by the likes of [Code.org](https://code.org/) and [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/).  [BabylonJS](http://www.babylonjs.com/) is a complete open source JavaScript library for building 3D games with HTML5, WebGL and Web Audio.  It is used by the likes of [Assassin's Creed Pirates](http://assassinscreed.ubi.com/en-us/games/assassins-creed-pirates.aspx) and others to deliver Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) accelerated 3D and 2D graphics in the browser on desktop, tablet, mobile, and even [virtual reality](http://www.slashgear.com/webgl-plants-game-in-oculus-rift-with-one-line-of-code-03323659/) devices without the need for plugins. 

Babylon Blocks is an open source project to combine these two awesome technologies by creating a library of Blockly blocks that interface with BabylonJS.  These so-called "babylon blocks" will not only make it possible to build 3D games and web applications visually, but will make learning 3D graphics programming fun and easy.

## Installing Babylon Blocks

Installing Babylon Blocks on your local machine so you can contribute or incorporate it into your own projects is easy.

## Contributing to Babylon Blocks

__There are two ways you can help__
* Build a babylon block using the instructions below (if everyone builds one block we can have this done in no time!).
* Donate $5 [here](https://developers.oraculuum.com/babylonblocks/demo/index.html) so we can pay someone to build a Babylon Block in your name.  The text "Dedicated to: your name here (or alter ego)" will be appended to the end of your block's tooltip... so that every time someone hovers over your block to learn more about it... they'll be forced to reflect on your greatness!

__Building a Babylon Block__  

Building a babylon block involves choosing a block to build, designing the block using the [Block Factory](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/blockfactory/index.html), defining a code generator for the block, adding the block to the blockly toolbox, and creating documentation for the block so others can use it.

1. Choose a babylon block to adopt from our "Adopt a Block List" at the bottom of this readme or add a Babylon Block of your choosing to the "Adopt a Block List" so everyone knows you're working on it.

   e.g. [BABYLON.Mesh.CreateSphere(name, segments, diameter, scene, updatable)](http://www.sokrate.fr/documentation/babylonjs/BABYLON.Mesh.html)

2. Design your block using the [Block Factory](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/blockfactory/index.html).  A video tutorial showing how to use the Block Factory can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2_xaEvcVI0).

## Project History

Babylon Blocks was started as a side-project by Oraculuum's founder, John Nicholson, when he needed to teach a local Meetup group 3D graphics. Â Since then it has matured into a full-fledged open source project supported by Oraculuum's Open Source Team, the Babylon Blocks community here on GitHub, and individual donors.
