## About

[Google Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) is an open source library for building visual programming editors and is used by the likes of [Code.org](https://code.org/) and [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/).  [BabylonJS](http://www.babylonjs.com/) is a complete open source JavaScript library for building 3D games with HTML5, WebGL and Web Audio.  It is used by the likes of [Assassin's Creed Pirates](http://assassinscreed.ubi.com/en-us/games/assassins-creed-pirates.aspx) and others to deliver Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) accelerated 3D and 2D graphics in the browser on desktop, tablet, mobile, and even [virtual reality](http://www.slashgear.com/webgl-plants-game-in-oculus-rift-with-one-line-of-code-03323659/) devices without the need for plugins. 

Babylon Blocks is an open source project to combine these two awesome technologies by creating a library of Blockly blocks that interface with BabylonJS.  These so-called "babylon blocks" will not only make it possible to build 3D games and web applications visually, but will make learning 3D graphics programming fun and easy.

## Installing Babylon Blocks

Installing Babylon Blocks on your local machine so you can contribute or incorporate it into your own projects is easy.

## Contributing to Babylon Blocks

__There are two ways you can help__
* Build a Babylon Block using the instructions below.
* Donate $5 [here](https://developers.oraculuum.com/babylonblocks/demo/index.html) so we can pay someone to build a Babylon Block in your name.

__Building a Babylon Block__  

Building a Babylon Block involves choosing a block to build, designing the block using the Block Factory, defining a code generator for the block, and adding the block to the blockly toolbox.

1. Choose a Babylon Block to adopt from our "Adopt a Block List" at the bottom of this readme or add a Babylon Block of your choosing to the "Adopt a Block List" so everyone knows you're working on it.

## Project History

Babylon Blocks was started as a side-project by Oraculuum's founder, John Nicholson, when he needed to teach a local Meetup group 3D graphics. Â Since then it has matured into a full-fledged open source project supported by Oraculuum's Open Source Team, the Babylon Blocks community here on GitHub, and individual donors.
